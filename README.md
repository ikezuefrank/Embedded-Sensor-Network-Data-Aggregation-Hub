## 1. Project Title and Overview

**Embedded Sensor Network Data Aggregation Hub** is a command-line Python
application that simulates the kind of heterogeneous sensor network used in
Nigerian manufacturing, oil & gas, and power-generation plants. Five sensor
types — temperature, pressure, vibration, gas concentration and flow rate —
produce readings that travel over three simulated protocols (MQTT, Modbus, CAN
Bus) to a central `AggregationHub`. The hub calibrates each reading, evaluates
configurable threshold rules, queues alerts by severity, tracks battery
depletion on wireless nodes, and exports a JSON-serialisable summary of
everything it has seen. There is no GUI and no database — by design — it is a
tested, documented OOP core that exercises classes, encapsulation, inheritance
(including cooperative multiple inheritance), polymorphism and duck typing.

## 4. System Architecture

![UML Class Diagram](uml/class_diagram.png)

The design is built around two parallel ABC hierarchies and a hub that ties
them together. `SensorNode` defines the sensor interface and the five concrete
nodes only vary their unit, safe range and alarm threshold — so the reading
simulation lives once in the base and each node reuses it. `CommunicationProtocol`
does the same for the three transport stubs. The `AggregationHub` **composes**
its `SensorNode` instances: once a sensor is registered the hub owns it, polls
it and keeps its history, so the part's role is bound to the whole (filled
diamond). By contrast the hub only **aggregates** `AlertRule` objects — rules are
created independently and passed in with `add_alert_rule()`, the hub merely
holds a reference, and the same rule could outlive or be shared beyond one hub
(hollow diamond). `WirelessSensorNode` uses cooperative multiple inheritance
from `SensorNode` and `BatteryPoweredMixin`, relying on Python's MRO and
`super()` so both initialisers run. Polymorphism shows up in two places: the hub
treats every sensor uniformly through the `SensorNode` interface, and
`DataPipeline.process()` accepts anything satisfying the `Readable` protocol
rather than a specific class.

## 5. How to Run

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/ikezuefrank/Embedded-Sensor-Network-Data-Aggregation-Hub.git
cd Embedded-Sensor-Network-Data-Aggregation-Hub

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate          # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies (just pytest)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the demonstration
python main.py

# 5. Run the test suite
pytest tests/ -v
```

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

## 6. Sample Output

Real output from `python main.py` (the run is seeded, so it reproduces):

```
Hub: Lagos-Refinery-Unit-3  (7 sensors registered)

Protocol uplinks (same interface, three transports):
  MQTTProtocol(hub-uplink -> localhost:1883, connected)
  ModbusProtocol(addr=7 @ 9600 baud, connected)
  CANBusProtocol(can1 @ 500000 bps, connected)

Replayed 24h -> 336 readings across 7 sensors.

Alerts raised: 29
  CRITICAL 5
  HIGH     6
  MEDIUM   17
  LOW      1

Earliest alerts:
  16:06  [MEDIUM] SN-FLOW-05: value 480.29 L/min out of band [0.0, 450.0]
  17:06  [MEDIUM] SN-PRES-02: value 9.05 bar out of band [0.0, 9.0]
  18:36  [MEDIUM] SN-FLOW-05: value 452.24 L/min out of band [0.0, 450.0]
  19:06  [MEDIUM] SN-VIBR-03: value 20.28 mm/s out of band [0.0, 20.0]

Per-sensor summary:
{
  "SN-TEMP-01": {
    "count": 48, "mean": 49.203, "min": -36.293, "max": 132.369,
    "std_dev": 50.695, "alert_counts": { "HIGH": 1 }
  },
  "SN-GASC-04": {
    "count": 48, "mean": 18.003, "min": 0.364, "max": 94.243,
    "std_dev": 22.494, "alert_counts": { "CRITICAL": 5, "MEDIUM": 1 }
  },
  "SN-WTMP-06": {
    "count": 48, "mean": 61.896, "min": -36.59, "max": 150.0,
    "std_dev": 60.163, "alert_counts": { "LOW": 1 }
  }
  ... (one block per sensor)
}
```

## 7. Known Limitations

These are deliberate simplifications, not unfinished work:

- **Sensor data is random, not real.** Each `read()` draws a plausible value
  (with an occasional spike to exercise the alert path) instead of replaying a
  recorded trace. Values are reproducible only because `main.py` seeds the RNG.
- **Protocols are in-memory stubs.** `MQTTProtocol`, `ModbusProtocol` and
  `CANBusProtocol` model the connect/send/receive/disconnect lifecycle (and a
  small random connection-timeout) but open no real sockets and move no real
  frames. They demonstrate the polymorphic interface; they are not a network
  stack.
- **Everything is in memory.** Readings and alerts live in the hub for the
  length of one run. There is no persistence, file export beyond the printed
  JSON, or database — the brief does not require one.
- **Battery model is linear.** `discharge_per_reading` is subtracted flat per
  read; there is no temperature/load curve. A low-battery alert is timestamped
  with the wall clock at discharge time, so in a replayed 24-hour run it sorts
  after the (back-dated) threshold alerts.
- **Polling is single-threaded and synchronous.** `poll_all()` reads every
  sensor in turn; there is no concurrency or real-time scheduling.
- **`self_test()` is deterministic** — it passes unless the calibration offset
  has been forced out of range, rather than randomly simulating hardware faults.
